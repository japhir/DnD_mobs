We're running a massive final D&D 5e battlefield, and would like to roll the
dice! but having to roll 20d20 to determine if your army of archers hits is a
pain so here is some R code to simulate dice-rolls for large groups of mobs.

It shows you exactly what was rolled so you can still cheer on your army of
champions! (except for individual damage dice, but I don't care too much about
that).
